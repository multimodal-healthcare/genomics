## Description   
Code related to the paper "Neural network-based integration of polygenic and clinical information: Development and validation of a prediction model for 10 year risk of major adverse cardiac events in the UK Biobank cohort". 
This repo is a python package for preprocessing UK Biobank data and preprocessing, training and evaluating the NeuralCVD score.

![NeuralCVD](./src/neuralcvd_fig1.png?raw=true "NeuralCVD")

## Methods
**NeuralCVD** is based on the fantastic [Deep Survival Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.01176) Paper, the original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/autonlab/DeepSurvivalMachines).

## Assets
This repo contains code to preprocess [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) data, train the NeuralCVD score and analyze/evaluate its performance.

- Preprocessing involves: parsing primary care records for desired diagnosis, aggregating the cardiovascular risk factors analyzed in the study and calculating predefined polygenic risk scores.
- Training involves Model specification via pytorch-lightning and hydra.
- Postprocessing involve extensive benchmarks with linear Models, and calculation of bootstrapped metrics.


## How to train the NeuralCVD Model  
1. First, install dependencies   
```bash
# clone project   
git clone https://github.com/thbuerg/NeuralCVD

# install project   
cd NeuralCVD
pip install -e .   
pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```   

2. Download UK Biobank data. Execute preprocessing notebooks on the downloaded data.

3. Edit the `.yaml` config files in `neuralcvd/experiments/config/`:
```yaml
setup:
  project_name: <YourNeptuneSpace>/<YourProject>
  root_dir: absolute/path/to/this/repo/
experiment:
  tabular_filepath: path/to/processed/data
```

4. Set up [Neptune.ai](https://www.neptune.ai)

5. Train the NeuralCVD Model (make sure you are on a machine w/ GPU)
 ```bash
# module folder
cd neuralcvd

# run training
bash experiments/run_NeuralCVD_S.sh
```
